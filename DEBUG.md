# Debugging in EmonCMS

As a newcomer to the EmonCMS codebase it's difficult to understand the flow of control.
It's also important when testing updated code to see what's going on with the data. The
current logging mechanism provides a way of inserting INFO, WARNING or ERROR messages
which works well. However it's desirable to have the ability to insert low-overhead debugging messages
into the code permanently, which can then be enabled individually at the file level via
configuration changes. To do this the existing EmonLogger code was used in a way that does
not affect the existing logging.

## Creating debug log entries

The function `debug` was introduced. It is a variadic argument function that inspects each
argument and converts it into a suitable string, concatenating the strings into the final
debug message. It can be used identically to the existing log functions, for example:

    $this->log->debug("I am here looking at the lastvalue: $lastvalue");

The drawback with this is that the string message must be interpolated every time this
function is called, even if debugging is disabled. This isn't too serious for a simple
inclusion, but if the expression is more complex, say reducing an array, then it can be a
significant overhead. The solution is lazy evaluation by passing this as follows:

    $this->log->debug("I am here looking at the lastvalue: ",$lastvalue);

In this case the interpolation is only done if debugging is enabled. As an added bonus you
can pass more complex structures and the debug code will turn them into a string form. The
maximum length for arrays is configurable allowing even large data items to feature in the
debug log in an abbreviated form. This is often good enough.

## Configuring Debug Logging

There are two configurable parameters in `settings.ini`:

    ; List the files (without extension) in which you want debugging to be activated
    debug = ; PHPFina PHPTimeSeries VirtualFeed feed_model process_model process_processlist
    ; Maximum number of array elements to dump
    debug_maxlen = 10
